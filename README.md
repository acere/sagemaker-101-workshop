# Getting Started with Amazon SageMaker

This repository accompanies a hands-on training event to introduce data scientists (and ML-ready developers / technical leaders) to core model training and deployment workflows with [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).

## Agenda

Sessions in suggested order:

* [builtin_algorithm_hpo_tabular](builtin_algorithm_hpo_tabular): Demonstrating how to use (and tune the hyperparameters of) a **pre-built, SageMaker-provided algorithm** (Applying XGBoost to tabular data)
* (Optional) [custom_sklearn_rf](custom_sklearn_rf): Introductory example showing how to **bring your own algorithm**, using SageMaker's SKLearn container environment as a base (Predicting housing prices)
* [custom_tensorflow_keras_nlp](custom_tensorflow_keras_nlp): Demonstrating how to **bring your own algorithm**, using SageMaker's TensorFlow container environment as a base (Classifying news headline text)
* [migration_challenge_keras_image](migration_challenge_keras_image): A challenge to use what you've learned to **migrate an existing notebook** to SageMaker model training job and real-time inference endpoint deployment (Classifying MNIST DIGITS images)


## Deploying in Your Own Account

Our standard setup for this workshop is detailed in [.ee.tpl.yaml](.ee.tpl.yaml), a [CloudFormation template](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/resources/templates/) file. You can deploy the same via the [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).

If you've [onboarded to SageMaker Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-studio-onboard.html) and would like to use that **instead** of a Notebook Instance, you'll need to take the following additional steps:

1. To download this repository, launch a **System terminal** (from the *Other* section of the launcher screen) and run `git clone https://github.com/apac-ml-tfc/sagemaker-workshop-101`.
1. You'll be asked to select a kernel when you first open each notebook, because the available kernels in Studio differ from those in Notebook Instances. Use **Python 3 (Data Science)** as standard and **Python 3 (TensorFlow CPU Optimized)** specifically for the 'local' notebooks in NLP and migration challenge folders (which fit TensorFlow models within the notebook itself).

You can refer to the [*"How Are Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks Different from Notebook Instances?"*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks-comparison.html) docs page for more details on differences between the Studio and Notebook Instance environments. As that page notes, SageMaker studio does not yet support [local mode](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/use-the-amazon-sagemaker-local-mode-to-train-on-your-notebook-instance/): which we find can be useful to accelerate debugging in the migration challenge, and is one reason we typically run this session on Notebook Instances instead.

## Further Reading

One major focus of this workshop is how SageMaker helps us right-size and seggregate compute resources for different ML tasks, without sacrificing (but ideally accelerating!) data scientist productivity.
